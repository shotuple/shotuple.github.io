STAGE 2 Background: Cookie & Session
===

# Cookie
- Cookie: Key + Value
- Characteristics of HTTP
  - Connectionless  
  Make one response to one request and then close the connection.
  - Stateless  
  Not saving state information after communication ends.
- Using cookies to maintain state despite both characteristics.
- When the server issues a cookie to the client, the client sends the cookie along with the request to the server.  
-> The server identifies the client by checking the cookie in the client's request.  
-> Since cookies are sent every time you communicate with the server, sending requests that don't require cookies wastes resources. To compensate for this drawback, it is now recommended to use the Modern Storage APIs to store data.
- Web servers use values stored in cookies to distinguish between users and logins for many clients.

- Because cookies are stored on the client, the client can view, modify, and add stored cookies.

# Session
- Store authentication status in cookies, but use sessions to prevent clients from tampering with credentials.
- Sessions work by storing authentication information on the server and generating a key(Session ID) to access that data and passing it to the client.

- **The key difference is that cookies are stored by the user, while sessions are stored by the server.**

## 예시
- 쿠키확인 
  - 크롬 우클릭 - 검사 - console - document.cookie 입력
  - application - cookies

## 연습
1. 로그인 페이지에서 검사 - Network 탭에서 Preserve log를 체크하고 로그인.
2. Application - Cookies 목록 안의 sessionid 헤더의 값을 복사.
3. sessionid를 Delete하고 새로고침하면 로그인이 풀림.
4. 복사해놓은 값을 sessionid 헤더로 추가하면 로그인 성공.
- If an attacker can steal a user's cookie, they can steal the user's authentication state for the session, which is known as session hijacking.
